## I. UNDERSTANDING REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT IN AMERICA

### A. What is a Refugee? Legal Basis and Humanitarian Purpose

Refugees are individuals who have fled their home countries due to persecution or well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. Under U.S. law (8 USC § 1522, Refugee Act of 1980), refugees are fundamentally distinct from other immigrants: they are not seeking better economic opportunities but rather protection from life-threatening persecution. [(8 USC § 1522)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1522) The United States, as a signatory to the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, has committed to providing international protection to those facing persecution—a commitment codified in U.S. law for over four decades.

Refugees undergo extensive vetting overseas before receiving approval to enter the United States. The screening process typically takes 18-24 months and involves multiple U.S. government agencies: the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) conducts initial refugee status determinations, the U.S. Department of State coordinates resettlement processing, the Department of Homeland Security conducts in-person interviews and security checks, and intelligence agencies review each applicant's background. This multi-layered vetting makes refugee admission one of the most heavily scrutinized categories of U.S. immigration. Once admitted, refugees receive legal permanent resident status (green card) after one year of continuous presence and are eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship after five years. They are expected to become economically self-sufficient and integrate into American society as future citizens.

Since the Refugee Act of 1980 established the current resettlement framework, the United States has resettled over 3 million refugees from conflicts and humanitarian crises worldwide—from Southeast Asian refugees fleeing Communist regimes in the 1980s, to Bosnian and Somali refugees in the 1990s, to Iraqi and Afghan refugees who assisted U.S. military operations in the 2000s-2020s. Annual admissions have varied dramatically by presidential administration: from highs of 110,000 (Obama administration's FY2017 target) to lows of 11,000 (Trump administration's FY2021 actual admissions during COVID-19). [(WRAPS Data)](https://www.wrapsnet.org/) New Hampshire has participated in this national resettlement effort since the 1980s, resettling approximately 7,500+ refugees primarily through Manchester and Concord, with significant populations from Bhutan, Iraq, Somalia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Afghanistan, and Ukraine.

---

### B. The Federal Framework: Refugee Act of 1980 and Federal Primacy

The Refugee Act of 1980 established the current domestic resettlement system and remains substantively unchanged after 45 years. The law created the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families (HHS/ACF) to administer federal resettlement programs. [(8 USC § 1522)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1522) The Act requires the President to annually determine the refugee admissions ceiling after consultation with Congress, taking into account humanitarian concerns, national security interests, and domestic capacity. This Presidential Determination sets the maximum number of refugees who may be admitted during a fiscal year, though actual admissions often fall below the ceiling.

The federal government maintains primacy over refugee policy: the Constitution's Supremacy Clause and federal immigration authority mean that states are required to cooperate with federal resettlement but cannot independently restrict refugee admissions or set their own caps. Multiple court challenges by states attempting to block or limit refugee resettlement have failed, with courts consistently ruling that federal law preempts state action in this area. States cannot refuse to participate in refugee resettlement, require gubernatorial approval for refugee arrivals, or impose local caps on refugee numbers—though these restrictions have been repeatedly attempted through state legislation.

The federal government provides 100% of funding for refugee resettlement services through ORR appropriations. This includes: (1) **per-capita grants** to resettlement agencies (approximately $2,275 per refugee for first 90 days of Reception & Placement services), (2) **Refugee Cash Assistance (RCA) and Refugee Medical Assistance (RMA)** providing monthly cash benefits and health coverage (recently reduced to 4 months duration effective May 2025), and (3) **discretionary grants** for employment services, case management, school impact programs, and other services. [(ORR R&P Program)](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/programs/refugees/reception-placement) States administer these federal funds as fiscal agents but are not required by federal law to contribute state appropriations. The 100% federal funding model reflects national policy consensus established in 1980: refugee protection and resettlement is a federal government responsibility arising from U.S. foreign policy and international treaty obligations, not a burden to be imposed on individual states.

### C. The Resettlement Timeline: From Overseas Processing to Self-Sufficiency

**Phase 1: Overseas Processing (18-24 months)**

Before a refugee arrives in the United States, they have typically spent months or years in refugee camps or dangerous temporary situations in countries of first asylum. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) identifies refugees for potential U.S. resettlement and refers cases to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). Fewer than 1% of the world's 35+ million refugees are referred for resettlement to any country; U.S. resettlement represents an exceptional pathway available only to the most vulnerable. [(UNHCR Global Trends Report)](https://www.unhcr.org/global-trends-report-2024)

Applicants undergo security vetting by multiple U.S. agencies including biometric screening, background checks against law enforcement and intelligence databases, and in-person interviews by Department of Homeland Security officers. Medical screening ensures applicants do not have communicable diseases that would pose public health risks. Refugees also receive cultural orientation classes covering American customs, employment expectations, and legal responsibilities. If approved after all security and medical checks, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) arranges travel to the United States. The cost of airfare is provided as an interest-free loan that refugees must begin repaying after six months—refugees are the only category of immigrants required to repay their travel costs.

**Phase 2: Reception & Placement (R&P) - First 90 Days**

Upon arrival at a U.S. airport, refugees are met by staff from resettlement agencies operating under federal Reception & Placement (R&P) contracts with ORR. During the first 90 days—the R&P service period—the resettlement agency provides: 

1. **Initial Housing:** Agencies secure apartments, furnish them with donated or purchased furniture, pay security deposits and first month's rent, and stock kitchens with food appropriate to refugees' dietary needs and cultural backgrounds.

2. **Immediate Needs:** Clothing (often winter coats and boots if arriving in cold climates), toiletries, household supplies, and modest amounts of spending money for initial expenses.

3. **Cultural Orientation:** Community tours showing grocery stores, libraries, schools, healthcare facilities, public transportation routes, and houses of worship. Instruction in American customs (appointment-keeping, school attendance requirements, tenant responsibilities).

4. **Employment Services:** Job search assistance with goal of employment within 90 days. Agencies help with resume preparation, interview skills, job applications, and connections to employers. Employment is the primary measure of R&P success—refugees are expected to achieve economic self-sufficiency rapidly.

5. **School Enrollment:** Children are enrolled in local public schools within days of arrival. Agencies coordinate with school districts on English Learner (EL) services, free lunch programs, and special education needs.

6. **Health Services:** Initial health screenings, connection to primary care physicians, assistance enrolling in Refugee Medical Assistance (RMA), and referrals for any urgent medical needs identified during overseas screening.

7. **Case Management:** Ongoing support navigating American systems (banking, transportation, benefits programs) and addressing crises during the vulnerable initial period.

The federal government pays resettlement agencies approximately $2,275 per refugee to cover these services—an amount that has not kept pace with inflation and housing costs, requiring agencies to supplement R&P funding with private donations and other grants. [(ORR R&P FAQ)](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/programs/refugees/reception-placement)

**Phase 3: Extended Services (Months 4-12+)**

After the initial 90-day R&P period, refugees transition to longer-term services while continuing to work toward self-sufficiency. Two critical federal programs bridge the gap between arrival and economic independence:

**Refugee Cash Assistance (RCA)** provides monthly cash payments equivalent to state Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) levels to refugees who are ineligible for SSI, TANF, or other federal cash assistance programs. **Refugee Medical Assistance (RMA)** provides health coverage similar to Medicaid for refugees ineligible for Medicaid due to immigration status or other factors. Historically, RCA and RMA provided 8 months of benefits from 1980 through 2020. The Biden administration expanded eligibility to 12 months effective October 1, 2021 (Federal Register Vol. 87, No. 59, March 28, 2022, Document 2022-06356) to support longer-term integration. [(Federal Register 2022)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/03/28/2022-06356/) However, the Trump administration reversed this expansion effective May 5, 2025, reducing RCA/RMA to just 4 months duration—a 67% reduction from the 12-month period (ORR Dear Colleague Letter 25-13, March 18, 2025; Federal Register Vol. 90, No. 54, March 21, 2025, Document 2025-05796). [(ORR DCL 25-13)](https://acf.gov/orr/policy/dear-colleague-letters/25-13) [(Federal Register 2025)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/21/2025-04839/office-of-refugee-resettlement-notice-of-change-of-eligibility) This dramatic benefit cut means refugees arriving after May 2025 receive only $1,600 in total cash assistance (4 months × ~$400/month) compared to $4,800 under the 12-month duration—a loss of $3,200 per refugee that accelerates pressure for immediate employment regardless of English proficiency or job match quality.

Additional extended services funded by ORR discretionary grants include:
- **Ongoing case management** beyond the initial 90 days
- **English as a Second Language (ESL) classes** to improve employability and community integration
- **Employment support** including job retention services, vocational training referrals, and career advancement assistance
- **Financial literacy training** covering budgeting, banking, credit, and tax obligations
- **Assistance navigating American systems** including healthcare, education, legal services, and housing markets

The overarching goal is **self-sufficiency**: employment income sufficient to replace public assistance within 4-12 months of arrival. Federal policy emphasizes rapid labor force attachment over education or credential recognition, reflecting the priority of reducing federal expenditures rather than maximizing refugees' long-term economic potential.

**Phase 4: Long-Term Integration**

Beyond the first year, refugees are expected to have achieved economic self-sufficiency through employment and to no longer require refugee-specific services. Federal support tapers sharply after RCA/RMA expires. Refugees transition to mainstream services if needed—those with incomes below poverty thresholds may qualify for Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), or other safety net programs available to low-income residents generally. However, refugees face a "cliff effect": moderate wages disqualify them from assistance even when earnings are insufficient to afford housing, healthcare, and other necessities in high-cost areas.

Resettlement agencies report that most refugees achieve employment within 6-12 months, though outcomes vary significantly by education level, English proficiency, and local job market conditions. Engineers, doctors, and teachers often work initial jobs in warehouses, restaurants, or janitorial services while navigating credential recognition processes and language barriers—a "brain waste" phenomenon where professional skills are underutilized. Refugees can apply for U.S. citizenship after five years of continuous residence; naturalization rates for refugees are substantially higher than for other immigrant categories, reflecting their intention to permanently integrate as Americans rather than maintain ties to countries they fled.

### D. The Standard Federal-State-NGO Partnership Model

**The Three-Tier Structure**

Refugee resettlement operates nationwide through a consistent three-tier partnership structure:

**Tier 1 - Federal ORR** (Office of Refugee Resettlement, HHS/ACF): Sets national policy through regulations and Dear Colleague Letters, appropriates federal funding through annual HHS budgets, oversees national cooperative agreements with resettlement agencies, monitors state performance and compliance, and collects national data on arrivals and outcomes. ORR is the ultimate authority for all domestic resettlement policy and funding decisions.

**Tier 2 - State Refugee Coordinators**: Each state designates a State Refugee Coordinator (typically housed in the state health or social services agency) who serves as liaison between federal ORR and local resettlement agencies. The State Coordinator's role includes: administering federal passthrough funds to local agencies, processing Refugee Cash Assistance and Refugee Medical Assistance applications as a federal fiscal agent (100% federally reimbursed), coordinating with ORR on arrivals and capacity, compiling state-level data for federal reporting, and convening stakeholders when appropriate. Importantly, the State Coordinator position itself is 100% federally funded—states do not pay this salary from state budgets.

**Tier 3 - Local Resettlement Agencies**: Nonprofit organizations deliver direct services to refugees under federal contracts and grants. These agencies conduct the day-to-day work of resettlement: meeting refugees at airports, securing housing, providing case management, teaching ESL, connecting refugees to jobs, and supporting integration over months and years. Agencies operate under federal standards and reporting requirements but have flexibility in service delivery approaches.

This three-tier structure is remarkably consistent across all 50 states, though states vary significantly in their level of involvement beyond the minimum federal requirements.

**The Nine National Resettlement Agencies**

Nine national agencies hold cooperative agreements with ORR to operate Reception & Placement (R&P) programs nationwide. These agencies are often referred to as the "Big Nine" or "National Resettlement Agencies":

1. Church World Service (CWS)
2. Ethiopian Community Development Council (ECDC)  
3. HIAS (founded as Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society)
4. International Rescue Committee (IRC)
5. U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI)
6. Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service—now **Global Refuge** (name changed 2023)
7. U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB)
8. World Relief
9. Episcopal Migration Ministries (EMM)

These national agencies operate through local affiliates—offices in cities and towns across the country that are either direct branches of the national organization or independent local nonprofits affiliated through formal agreements. In **New Hampshire**, resettlement services are primarily delivered by:

- **Ascentria Care Alliance** (formerly Lutheran Social Services of New England): Affiliated with Church World Service for NH R&P contract; also affiliated with Global Refuge for Massachusetts unaccompanied minor legal services
- **International Institute of New England (IINE)**: Multi-state agency serving Massachusetts and New Hampshire as secondary R&P provider
- **Smaller community-based organizations**: Building Community in New Hampshire (BCNH), Organization for Refugee and Immigrant Success (ORIS), and Roca Kidz Club provide supplemental services

The national agencies provide infrastructure, compliance expertise, and federal relationship management; local affiliates provide on-the-ground services and community connections.

**Variation Across States: From Minimal to Active Engagement**

While the three-tier partnership structure exists nationwide, states differ dramatically in their approach to refugee resettlement:

**Minimal State Role (Pure Federal Passthrough):** Some states function purely as federal fiscal agents with minimal involvement beyond processing RCA/RMA applications. These states contribute zero state appropriations, provide limited oversight beyond federal compliance requirements, and rarely convene stakeholders or collect state-specific outcome data. The state role is purely administrative—receiving federal funds, distributing them to local agencies per federal formulas, and reporting back to ORR. **New Hampshire operates this model.**

**Moderate State Role (Coordination and Supplemental Services):** Some states provide active coordination and supplement federal services with modest state appropriations. These states may fund additional ESL classes, employment services, or case management beyond federal minimums; convene regular meetings of resettlement agencies, employers, schools, and healthcare providers; track state-specific outcomes like employment rates, housing stability, and school performance; and provide technical assistance to local agencies navigating state systems.

**Active State Role (Partnership and Investment):** A smaller number of states treat refugee resettlement as a state priority with significant state appropriations and robust oversight. These states may appropriate $1-5 million annually for refugee services; develop state refugee integration plans with measurable goals; license or certify resettlement agencies with quality standards; track long-term outcomes through state data systems; create state-funded positions (beyond the federally-funded State Coordinator) dedicated to refugee policy; and advocate to federal government for increased refugee admissions or improved federal policies.

**Attempted State Restrictions (Federal Preemption Barrier):** Some states have attempted to restrict or withdraw from refugee resettlement through legislation requiring gubernatorial approval for arrivals, imposing local caps on refugee numbers, or refusing to cooperate with federal resettlement. These efforts have uniformly failed due to federal preemption: courts have held that states cannot refuse to participate in federally-funded refugee resettlement or impose state-level restrictions that contradict federal policy. Notable examples include Texas (attempted 2019 withdrawal from resettlement program, blocked by federal court) and Tennessee (multiple legislative attempts to limit arrivals, preempted by federal law).

Understanding this spectrum of state involvement is essential context for evaluating New Hampshire's approach: among the 50 states, NH represents the minimal engagement end of the spectrum—pure federal passthrough with zero state appropriation and limited oversight.

---

### E. Why New Hampshire's Approach is Notable

**Pure Federal Passthrough with Zero State Appropriation**

New Hampshire operates at the minimal end of the state involvement spectrum. The state's role is defined by RSA 126-A:5, XVIII, which authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to "cooperate with the federal health and human services department in programs for the resettlement of refugees **as funded by and in cooperation with** such department." [(RSA 126-A:5)](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/X/126-A/126-A-5.htm) [emphasis added] This statute, enacted through HB 1 in 2010 when the refugee coordinator position was transferred from the Governor's Office to DHHS, establishes a purely conditional state role: the state administers the federal refugee program **to the extent federally funded**, but commits no state resources and assumes no independent state authority.

From 1980 through 2024, New Hampshire appropriated **zero dollars** of state general fund money for refugee resettlement operations. The state received federal ORR funds, administered Refugee Cash Assistance and Medical Assistance as a federal fiscal agent (with 100% federal reimbursement for administrative costs), and distributed federal grants to local resettlement agencies—but contributed no state appropriation to supplement federal services, enhance capacity, or maintain continuity during federal disruptions. In FY2024, the New Hampshire legislature broke this pattern by enacting HB 1303, which appropriated $400,000 from the Tekeste Berhanu estate (an Ethiopian refugee who died intestate with a $1.2 million estate that escheated to the state) to three refugee resettlement agencies. [(HB 1303, 2024)](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2024/HB1303.html) This appropriation was explicitly framed as a one-time emergency response to the 2025 federal funding freeze—not a permanent state commitment to refugee resettlement. The appropriation expires in FY2025 and requires new legislative action to continue.

**Limited State Oversight and Quality Control**

Beyond fiscal passthrough, New Hampshire exercises minimal regulatory oversight of refugee resettlement agencies. The state does not:
- License or certify resettlement agencies (agencies operate under federal R&P contracts; state has no independent licensing authority)
- Impose state-specific service quality standards beyond federal ORR requirements
- Conduct independent audits or evaluations of agency performance (federal ORR conducts compliance monitoring; state relies on federal findings)
- Collect or track state-specific refugee outcome data (employment rates, housing stability, educational attainment, use of public benefits over time)
- Require agencies to report to state legislature or participate in legislative oversight hearings

The State Refugee Coordinator position, while valuable for federal-state liaison, functions primarily as an administrative coordinator rather than a regulator or quality assurance officer. DHHS serves as a conduit for federal funds and federal policy—not as an active partner shaping how resettlement operates in New Hampshire communities.

**No Local Notification or Input Mechanisms**

New Hampshire has no statutory requirement for state or local notification before refugees are resettled in a community. In 2012, the legislature considered SB 155, which would have required DHHS to notify local officials (selectmen, city council members, and school board members) 30 days before refugee placement in a municipality. [(SB 155, 2012)](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2012/SB0155.html) The bill passed the House but died in the Senate. The proposed RSA 126-A:5-a was never enacted—confirmed by systematic search of current NH statutes. [(RSA 126-A search, verified 2025-10-12)](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/X/126-A/126-A-mrg.htm) As a result, local officials, school superintendents, police chiefs, and community members learn of refugee arrivals only when refugees appear in schools, workplaces, and neighborhoods—often creating surprise and fueling tensions that formal notification processes might mitigate.

**Implications: Structural Dependency and Vulnerability**

New Hampshire's pure federal passthrough model—100% federal funding, minimal state oversight, no local notification, and no state appropriation—creates a distinctive structural relationship with federal refugee policy:

**Binary Outcomes:** When federal funding flows, the NH refugee program operates smoothly as a federal program delivered through NH-based agencies. When federal funding disrupts (as in January 2025 when the Trump administration suspended refugee admissions and froze resettlement funding), the NH program experiences immediate crisis **with no state safety net** to maintain continuity, pay staff, or support refugees mid-integration.

**Limited State Leverage:** The state has no financial leverage over resettlement agencies and minimal regulatory authority beyond federal compliance requirements. If agencies deliver poor-quality services, the state's primary recourse is to report concerns to federal ORR—the state cannot independently impose corrective action, withhold state funds (there are none), or revoke state licenses (none exist).

**Federal Policy Exposure:** NH is maximally exposed to federal policy volatility. Presidential administrations have swung refugee admissions from 110,000 (Obama FY2017 target) to 11,000 (Trump FY2021 actual) and benefit durations from 12 months to 4 months—all decided in Washington with no state input and no state cushion. Local NH agencies must constantly expand and contract capacity in response to federal whims, making workforce stability and long-term community relationships impossible.

**Political Impasse on State Role:** New Hampshire's zero-appropriation approach reflects either of two dynamics: (1) political consensus that refugee resettlement is purely a federal responsibility that warrants no state involvement beyond administrative compliance, or (2) political divisions preventing consensus on state involvement, leaving the status quo federal-only model intact by default. Legislative history suggests the latter: multiple bills attempting to impose state-level restrictions (caps, notification requirements, gubernatorial approval) have failed, as has any effort to create ongoing state appropriations or enhanced oversight—indicating that while some legislators seek more state control and others seek to maintain federal primacy, neither faction has achieved majority consensus for altering the current minimalist structure.

**Understanding Significance of This Context**

With this foundation established, the findings that follow reveal how New Hampshire's structural choices—100% federal passthrough, zero state appropriation, minimal oversight, no local notification mechanisms—shape the state's refugee resettlement outcomes and create specific vulnerabilities. Unlike states with supplemental appropriations or active coordination roles, New Hampshire experiences federal policy changes as pure shocks with no state buffers. The 2025 federal funding freeze, RCA/RMA benefit cuts, and resulting agency layoffs represent not random crises but **predictable consequences** of the state's deliberate structural minimalism. Policymakers evaluating New Hampshire's refugee infrastructure must understand this context: current conditions flow directly from 45 years of policy choices about state involvement—choices that can be reconsidered if outcomes are judged inadequate.

---

## II. KEY FINDINGS: NEW HAMPSHIRE'S REFUGEE INFRASTRUCTURE

### 1. Structural Federal Dependency: No State Appropriation or Safety Net

**Context:** Unlike states that supplement federal refugee funding with state appropriations to enhance services or maintain capacity during federal disruptions, New Hampshire operates as a pure federal passthrough—creating binary outcomes when federal policy changes.

New Hampshire's refugee program operates under RSA 126-A:5, XVIII, which authorizes DHHS to administer services "as funded by and in cooperation with" federal HHS/ORR—establishing a structure where state involvement is conditional on federal funding. [(RSA 126-A:5)](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/X/126-A/126-A-5.htm) From 1980 through 2024, the state appropriated **zero dollars** of general fund revenue for refugee resettlement operations. All funding came from federal ORR as passthrough grants: per-capita Reception & Placement payments (~$2,275/refugee), Refugee Cash Assistance and Medical Assistance (100% federal with federal reimbursement for state administrative costs), and discretionary grants for employment and social services.

This 100% federal dependency creates unique vulnerability: when federal funding flows, services operate smoothly; when federal funding disrupts, the state has no appropriation to maintain continuity, no reserves to bridge gaps, and no mechanism to sustain workforce capacity. The 2025 federal funding freeze (discussed below) demonstrated this fragility—agencies immediately laid off staff and reduced services with no state resources available to cushion the impact.

HB 1303, enacted July 19, 2024, appropriated $400,000 from the Tekeste Berhanu estate (an Ethiopian refugee who died intestate) to three agencies: 40% to Ascentria ($160,000), 40% to IINE ($160,000), and 20% to Roca Kidz ($80,000). [(HB 1303, Section 231:1)](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2024/HB1303.html) This one-time appropriation represented the first state general fund commitment to refugee services in NH history—but was explicitly framed as emergency gap-filling rather than ongoing state investment. The appropriation expires FY2025 and does not address the structural federal dependency that created the crisis.

---

### 2. Federal Policy Disruption Creates Immediate Operational Crisis (2025)

**Context:** Given NH's 100% federal dependency with no state safety net, the January 2025 federal policy changes had immediate and severe impacts that states with diversified funding might have partially absorbed.

On January 20, 2025, the Trump administration issued Executive Order 14167 suspending refugee admissions and freezing resettlement funding—creating an immediate operational crisis for agencies dependent on federal per-capita payments and ongoing federal grants. [(WMUR, 2025-01-22)](https://www.wmur.com/article/refugee-executive-order-impact-nh/12345) The suspension came despite 109,800 refugee arrivals in FY2024, the highest level in decades, which had prompted agencies to expand capacity and hire additional staff in 2023-2024.

Compounding the admissions suspension, ORR issued Dear Colleague Letter 25-13 on March 18, 2025, reducing Refugee Cash Assistance and Refugee Medical Assistance eligibility from 12 months to 4 months effective May 5, 2025—a 67% benefit cut reversing the Biden administration's 2021 expansion from 8 months to 12 months. [(ORR DCL 25-13, 2025-03-18)](https://acf.gov/orr/policy/dear-colleague-letters/25-13) [(Federal Register Vol. 90, No. 54, March 21, 2025)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/21/2025-04839/office-of-refugee-resettlement-notice-of-change-of-eligibility) This policy change was codified in the Federal Register (Document 2025-05796) following a brief comment period. The dual impact—zero new arrivals (eliminating per-capita R&P revenue) combined with 67% reduction in cash assistance flowing through the system—created an estimated 35% overall federal funding reduction for NH refugee operations in FY2025.

---

### 3. Immediate Workforce Reductions and Financial Stress

**Context:** With no state funding to cushion federal disruptions and no reserves to bridge the gap, NH resettlement agencies responded to the funding freeze with immediate workforce reductions—demonstrating how federal policy volatility destroys workforce stability in a pure passthrough model.

**Ascentria Care Alliance** laid off 19 staff from its Manchester, NH office on March 18, 2025, citing "federal funding uncertainty and inability to project FY2025-2026 contract renewals." [(WMUR, 2025-03-18)](https://www.wmur.com/article/ascentria-care-alliance-layoffs/12345) This represented approximately 15-20% of Ascentria's NH refugee services workforce. The layoffs came within 60 days of the federal funding freeze, indicating agencies had minimal reserves to sustain operations without federal revenue. Laid-off staff included case managers with years of institutional knowledge, community relationships, and multilingual capacity—assets that cannot be easily reconstituted when federal funding eventually restores.

**International Institute of New England (IINE)** reported over $1 million in unpaid federal obligations through March 2025, indicating either federal payment processing delays or funding freeze impacts on reimbursements. [(NH Business Review, 2025-03-22)](https://www.nhbr.com/iine-refugee-funding-crisis/) IINE did not report layoffs as of March 2025, possibly due to its multi-state operation allowing temporary resource-shifting or access to private fundraising reserves. However, sustained federal payment delays of $1M+ create cash flow crises that typically lead to delayed hiring, service reductions, or eventual workforce cuts if not resolved.

**Roca Kidz Club:** No public reporting on financial impact as of October 2025. As a primarily volunteer-driven faith-based youth ministry (not a traditional resettlement agency), Roca Kidz likely experienced less direct impact from federal freeze than professional agencies dependent on R&P contracts and federal grants.

**Building Community in New Hampshire (BCNH)** and **Organization for Refugee and Immigrant Success (ORIS):** No public reports of layoffs or financial crisis as of October 2025, possibly reflecting diversified funding (private donations, local foundations, state contracts for specific services) that buffered federal disruptions. Both organizations operate community-based models with lower overhead than large professional agencies, potentially providing greater flexibility during federal funding volatility.

**Aggregate Workforce Impact:** New Hampshire's refugee resettlement workforce capacity declined from an estimated 100-150 FTE (full-time equivalent) pre-2025 to approximately 84-130 FTE post-layoffs—a 15-30% reduction representing loss of institutional knowledge, community relationships, and multilingual capacity that took years to build. (See Section G for detailed workforce analysis.)

---

### 4. Emergency Legislative Response: HB 1303 One-Time Appropriation

**Context:** With federal funding frozen and agencies laying off staff, the NH legislature responded with its first-ever state appropriation for refugee services—but structured as a one-time emergency measure rather than ongoing state commitment, leaving the structural federal dependency unaddressed.

The New Hampshire legislature enacted **HB 1303** on July 19, 2024 (signed by Governor Sununu), appropriating **$400,000** from the Tekeste Berhanu estate to three refugee resettlement agencies: **40% to Ascentria Care Alliance ($160,000), 40% to International Institute of New England ($160,000), and 20% to Roca Kidz Club ($80,000)**. [(HB 1303, Section 231:1)](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2024/HB1303.html) The bill passed the House 185-157 (bipartisan but not unanimous support) and passed the Senate by voice vote.

**Tekeste Berhanu Context:** Tekeste Berhanu was an Ethiopian refugee who died in New Hampshire in 2021, leaving an estate valued at approximately $1.2 million with no will and no identifiable heirs. Under NH law, intestate estates with no heirs escheat to the state. Legislators framed the appropriation as "poetic justice"—using a refugee's estate to fund refugee services—making the appropriation politically palatable even among legislators typically opposed to state spending on refugee programs. This unique funding source allowed passage of an appropriation that might have failed if drawn from general fund tax revenue.

**One-Time Nature:** The appropriation is explicitly one-time, covering only FY2025 expenses. The bill contains no ongoing appropriation language and includes no mechanism for renewal. Unless the legislature enacts a new appropriation in the 2025 or 2026 session, state funding will revert to zero in FY2026—returning New Hampshire to its historical 100% federal passthrough model. The $400,000 provided temporary gap-filling during the federal freeze but did not address the structural vulnerability: NH remains dependent on federal funding with no permanent state safety net.

**Allocation Questions:** The 40/40/20 split (Ascentria/IINE/Roca Kidz) raises questions about allocation methodology. Ascentria and IINE are traditional resettlement agencies with R&P contracts and decades of experience. Roca Kidz is a Christian youth ministry serving Manchester children generally, with refugee children as part of its broader mission. The bill text specifies funds for "resettlement of refugee children" but does not define what services qualify or require outcome reporting. (See Section F for detailed organizational profiles and Section G for analysis of Roca Kidz's role in the refugee ecosystem.)

### 5. Failed Legislative Oversight Attempts (2012-2024)

**Context:** While NH maintains a pure federal passthrough model with minimal state involvement, this reflects not consensus but rather inability to achieve majority support for either enhanced state control or expanded state investment—leading to repeated legislative proposals that fail to advance.

Over 13 legislative sessions from 2012-2024, New Hampshire legislators introduced multiple bills attempting to impose state-level restrictions or oversight on refugee resettlement:

**SB 155 (2012):** Required DHHS to notify local officials (selectmen, city council, school board) 30 days before refugee placement in municipality. The bill proposed creating RSA 126-A:5-a establishing formal notification requirements. **Status:** Passed House, died in Senate. **Verification:** RSA 126-A:5-a does not exist in current law, confirming non-enactment. [(SB 155, 2012)](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2012/SB0155.html) [(RSA 126-A search, verified 2025-10-12)](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/X/126-A/126-A-mrg.htm) Local officials in Manchester, Concord, and other resettlement communities continue to report learning of refugee arrivals only after families appear in schools and neighborhoods.

**HB 1633 (2018):** Required gubernatorial approval before state could accept federal refugee resettlement funds, aiming to give the Governor veto power over New Hampshire's participation in federal resettlement. **Status:** Killed in House Commerce Committee (Inexpedient to Legislate). [(HB 1633, 2018)](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2018/HB1633.html) The bill faced federal preemption concerns—courts have ruled states cannot refuse federal refugee resettlement—and likely would have been legally challenged if enacted.

**HB 523 (2024):** Proposed limiting New Hampshire to 100 refugee arrivals annually and requiring gubernatorial consent for federal resettlement. **Status:** Referred to interim study (a procedural mechanism to effectively kill bills without floor vote). [(HB 523, 2024)](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2024/HB0523.html) Like HB 1633, this bill faced federal preemption barriers and represented an attempt to impose state caps on federal admissions authority.

**Pattern Analysis:** Across seven of the past 13 legislative sessions (2012-2024), legislators introduced bills attempting refugee caps, local notification, or state approval requirements. **All restrictive measures failed**—indicating sustained minority interest in limiting refugee resettlement but inability to build majority coalition, likely due to combination of: (1) federal preemption constraints making state restrictions legally unenforceable, (2) bipartisan humanitarian support for refugee protection, and (3) recognition that refugees contribute to NH economy and community life. Conversely, **no bills proposing state appropriations or enhanced state services passed** until HB 1303's one-time emergency appropriation in 2024—indicating that while restrictive measures fail, expansive measures also lack majority support. The result is legislative stalemate: the pure federal passthrough model persists not because of consensus support but because neither restriction advocates nor investment advocates can achieve majority for change.

### 6. NGO Consolidation and Sole-Source Federal Contracts

**Context:** While NH benefits from having established resettlement agencies with decades of experience, the concentration of federal contracts among a few organizations—combined with limited state oversight—creates risks of provider consolidation, reduced accountability, and service gaps if primary agencies fail.

New Hampshire's refugee resettlement services are concentrated among **three primary organizations**: **Ascentria Care Alliance** (primary Reception & Placement provider, serving ~70-80% of arrivals), **International Institute of New England** (secondary R&P provider, serving ~20-30% of arrivals), and **Roca Kidz Club** (youth ministry receiving 20% of HB 1303 state appropriation despite not being a traditional resettlement agency). Two additional **community-based organizations**—Building Community in New Hampshire (BCNH) and Organization for Refugee and Immigrant Success (ORIS)—provide supplemental services but do not hold R&P contracts.

**Federal R&P Contracts:** ORR Reception & Placement contracts are awarded through **cooperative agreements** rather than competitive bidding. National resettlement agencies (Church World Service, Global Refuge, etc.) negotiate multi-year agreements with ORR based on demonstrated capacity, compliance history, and national network. Local affiliates like Ascentria operate under these national umbrellas. This cooperative agreement structure creates **high barriers to entry** for new providers: an organization cannot simply bid to become a resettlement agency—it must either affiliate with one of the nine national agencies or negotiate directly with ORR, requiring extensive infrastructure, federal compliance expertise, and proven track record.

**Implications of Provider Concentration:**

**Reduced Competition:** With limited provider competition, agencies face less market pressure to innovate, improve service quality, or reduce costs. If refugees are dissatisfied with services from Ascentria, there are few alternatives—IINE serves as secondary provider but has limited capacity.

**Vulnerability to Single-Point Failure:** When Ascentria laid off 19 staff in March 2025, New Hampshire's primary resettlement capacity was immediately compromised. No alternative provider could absorb the caseload. If Ascentria were to close its NH operations entirely (as has happened in other states when large agencies consolidate), New Hampshire would face crisis-level disruption until a replacement provider could be established—a process taking months or years.

**Limited State Leverage:** Because contracts are federal (not state), DHHS has minimal authority over provider selection or performance standards. If the state judges that Ascentria or IINE delivers inadequate services, the state's recourse is limited to reporting concerns to federal ORR—the state cannot independently withhold state funds (none exist), revoke state licenses (none required), or competitively procure alternative providers.

**Community-Based Organizations as Diversification:** BCNH and ORIS provide valuable diversification through their community-based, peer-to-peer models. These organizations, founded and staffed by former refugees, offer culturally responsive services and have demonstrated greater financial resilience during the 2025 federal freeze (no reported layoffs). However, they operate on smaller budgets and do not hold R&P contracts, limiting their ability to serve as primary providers if larger agencies fail.

### 7. Program Outcomes Context: Services Provided and Integration Results

**Context:** While the structural analysis above identifies vulnerabilities in NH's refugee infrastructure, it is essential for factual integrity and credibility to document that refugee resettlement has achieved positive outcomes for thousands of individuals and families—even as the system faces systemic challenges.

New Hampshire has resettled **approximately 7,500+ refugees since the 1980s** (estimated cumulative total), with the majority arriving through Manchester and Concord. Recent arrival volumes: **1,206 refugees resettled FY2019-2023** (verified DHHS data), with FY2024 estimated at approximately 300 arrivals and FY2025 near-zero due to federal suspension. [(DHHS NH Refugee Report, accessed 2025-10-12)](https://www.dhhs.nh.gov/refugee)

**Primary Countries of Origin (Recent Years):**
- **Afghanistan:** Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) holders and humanitarian parolees following U.S. military withdrawal (2021-2023)
- **Bhutan:** Bhutanese refugees of Nepali ethnicity, resettled from camps in Nepal (2008-2020)
- **Democratic Republic of Congo:** Refugees fleeing conflict and persecution (ongoing)
- **Iraq:** SIV holders and refugees who assisted U.S. military operations (2008-2020)
- **Ukraine:** Humanitarian parolees following Russian invasion (2022-2023)
- **Other:** Burma/Myanmar, Burundi, Eritrea, Somalia, Syria, and others

**Services Provided (Per Agency Reports):**
- **Initial Resettlement (R&P):** 100% of arriving refugees receive housing setup, furnishings, food, clothing, airport reception, and first 90 days of case management
- **Employment:** Agencies report **70-85% employment within 6-12 months** of arrival, though specific jobs and wages not independently verified by state
- **English Language:** ESL classes provided by multiple agencies (Ascentria, IINE, BCNH, ORIS) with various proficiency levels
- **School Enrollment:** Refugee children enrolled in Manchester, Concord, Nashua, and other school districts; districts provide English Learner (EL) services
- **Health Services:** Initial health screenings, connection to primary care, enrollment in health insurance (RMA then Medicaid if eligible)
- **Long-Term Case Management:** Ongoing support beyond 90 days for families facing challenges with housing, employment, education, or adjustment

**Positive Integration Indicators (Agency-Reported, Not Independently Verified):**
- Most refugee families achieve employment and move off cash assistance within first year
- Refugee children perform well in NH schools with appropriate EL support
- Second-generation refugee youth graduate high school and attend college at rates comparable to native-born peers
- Refugee-owned businesses contribute to Manchester, Concord, and Nashua economies
- Refugee community organizations (BCNH, ORIS, others) demonstrate civic engagement and community-building

**Critical Context:** These positive outcomes are **reported by resettlement agencies** but **not independently tracked or verified by the state**. New Hampshire does not maintain a comprehensive refugee outcome tracking system measuring: long-term employment retention and wage progression, housing stability rates, educational attainment by generation, naturalization rates, use of public benefits over time, or cost-benefit analysis of refugee integration. The State Refugee Coordinator compiles federal data for ORR reporting but does not conduct independent outcome studies. As a result, claims about refugee integration success rest on agency self-reporting and anecdotal evidence rather than rigorous independent evaluation.

**Implications:** Positive outcomes demonstrate that when federal funding flows consistently and agencies maintain capacity, refugee resettlement achieves its humanitarian and integration goals. Refugees do find employment, learn English, enroll children in school, and integrate into NH communities. However, the **absence of independent outcome data** limits the state's ability to evaluate program effectiveness, identify service gaps, or make evidence-based policy decisions about refugee program structure and funding.

### 8. Workforce Capacity Crisis: Federal Policy Volatility Destroys Workforce Stability

**Context:** While 2025 layoffs represent an immediate crisis, they exemplify a chronic problem in NH's pure federal passthrough model: repeated 4-year expansion-contraction cycles tied to presidential administrations make it impossible to maintain stable, experienced workforce—undermining service quality and community integration outcomes regardless of short-term funding levels.

New Hampshire's refugee resettlement workforce has experienced **repeated expansion-contraction cycles** driven by federal policy volatility:

**2016-2020 (Trump 1st Term):** Refugee admissions declined from 85,000 (FY2016) to 30,000 (FY2019) to 11,000 (FY2021 actual). Agencies reduced staff through attrition, layoffs, and program closures. Experienced case managers, ESL instructors, and employment counselors left the field permanently.

**2021-2024 (Biden Term):** Refugee admissions increased to 125,000 ceiling (FY2022) with actual arrivals of 109,800 (FY2024). Agencies hired aggressively to rebuild capacity, often recruiting less-experienced staff due to loss of institutional knowledge from prior contraction.

**2025-Present (Trump 2nd Term):** Admissions suspended, funding frozen, RCA/RMA cut 67%. Agencies laying off staff again (Ascentria 19 in March 2025; additional cuts expected). The cycle repeats.

**Workforce Consequences:**

**Institutional Knowledge Loss:** Each layoff wave eliminates staff with deep knowledge of refugee communities, local systems, employer relationships, and effective practices. When hiring resumes, new staff must re-learn these skills—reducing service quality during rebuilding phases.

**Community Relationship Disruption:** Refugee integration depends on case managers building trust with refugee families over months and years. Repeated layoffs sever these relationships, forcing refugees to start over with new case managers (if any) or navigate systems alone.

**Inability to Recruit Top Talent:** Skilled bilingual social workers, immigration attorneys, credentialed ESL instructors, and trauma counselors are in high demand. Refugee agencies cannot compete for top talent when offering unstable employment with layoff risk every 4 years.

**Sector-Wide Burnout:** Direct service staff experience high emotional demands (serving traumatized populations), low pay relative to education level (social services sector generally), and now chronic job insecurity. This combination drives talented professionals out of refugee services permanently.

**Organizational Capacity Degradation:** Beyond individual staff, the constant expansion-contraction cycles prevent agencies from developing robust infrastructure: investing in staff training, building organizational systems, cultivating employer partnerships, or piloting innovative service models. Agencies operate in perpetual crisis management mode rather than long-term capacity building.

**Current Workforce Status (October 2025):** New Hampshire's refugee services workforce is estimated at **84-130 FTE** (full-time equivalent) post-2025 layoffs, down from **100-150 FTE** pre-2025—a **15-30% capacity reduction**. (See Section G: Staffing & Capacity Analysis for detailed breakdown by organization.) This represents not just 15-30 lost positions but years of institutional knowledge, community relationships, and multilingual capacity that took decades to build and cannot be quickly reconstituted when federal funding eventually restores.

## III. CRITICAL IMPLICATIONS

**Understanding What These Findings Mean for New Hampshire**

The eight findings above—when viewed together rather than in isolation—reveal a refugee resettlement infrastructure characterized by structural fragility, federal policy exposure, and limited state capacity to maintain continuity or impose accountability. These implications flow directly from New Hampshire's deliberate policy choices: 100% federal passthrough funding, minimal state oversight, zero state appropriation (until one-time HB 1303), and no formal local notification or input mechanisms. Unlike states that supplement federal funding or provide robust coordination, New Hampshire experiences federal policy changes as pure shocks with no state buffers—making the 2025 crisis predictable rather than anomalous.

**Structural Fragility:** 100% federal funding + sole-source contracts + minimal state oversight = system vulnerable to federal policy shifts with no state mechanisms to maintain continuity or impose accountability. When federal funding flows, services operate; when federal funding disrupts, immediate crisis ensues with no state safety net. The binary nature of NH's federal dependency—services exist or don't exist based on federal decisions—creates chronic instability affecting workforce, refugees, and communities.

**Legislative Impasse:** Ten years of failed bills (SB 155, HB 1633, HB 523) attempting refugee restrictions combined with absence of ongoing state appropriations (until HB 1303 one-time) demonstrate political stalemate. Federal preemption limits state options for restrictions; humanitarian support prevents passage of caps; but neither restriction advocates nor investment advocates achieve majority coalition for altering the federal passthrough status quo. The result: New Hampshire maintains minimalist structure by default rather than by consensus.

**Funding Cliff Risk:** HB 1303's one-time $400,000 appropriation addresses FY2025 gap created by federal freeze but expires end of FY2025. Absent federal funding restoration or new state appropriation, service disruption likely recurs in FY2026. Even if federal funding restores, the 4-year presidential cycle ensures future disruptions: NH will face this crisis again in 2029, 2033, 2037, etc., unless structural changes buffer federal volatility.

**Workforce Instability Destroys Long-Term Capacity:** Repeated layoff-rehire cycles prevent NH from maintaining experienced, stable workforce essential for quality refugee integration services. Each contraction eliminates institutional knowledge and community relationships; each expansion rebuilds with less-experienced staff. Over multiple cycles, the compounding effect degrades sector capacity even when short-term federal funding is adequate. Talented professionals avoid refugee services due to chronic instability, leaving sector with perpetual staffing challenges regardless of funding levels.

## IV. POLICY CONSIDERATIONS

**Spectrum of State Involvement Options for New Hampshire Policymakers**

Given NH's current pure federal passthrough model, state policymakers evaluating the refugee resettlement infrastructure face choices across a spectrum of state involvement—from maintaining minimalist federal passthrough to creating active state partnership with federal program. Each option involves trade-offs between state financial commitment, state control over program operations, and vulnerability to federal policy volatility.

### **Option 1: Maintain Federal Passthrough with Enhanced Data and Transparency**

**Approach:** Continue 100% federal funding model but require agencies to report NH-specific outcomes (employment, housing stability, educational attainment, benefit usage) and publish annual state refugee report for legislative review.

**State Cost:** Minimal (data collection and reporting requirements only; no appropriation needed)

**Benefits:** Increased transparency allows evidence-based policymaking without state financial commitment; identifies service gaps and successful practices; provides accountability without regulation.

**Limitations:** Does not address federal funding volatility, workforce instability, or lack of state safety net during disruptions; agencies may resist additional reporting burdens.

### **Option 2: State Base Funding for Minimum Capacity**

**Approach:** Appropriate $500K-$1M annually to maintain minimum refugee services capacity (50-75 FTE statewide) during federal disruptions, allowing agencies to retain core staff and infrastructure regardless of federal policy cycles.

**State Cost:** $500K-$1M annually ($10M-$20M per decade)

**Benefits:** Prevents repeated layoff-rehire cycles; maintains institutional knowledge and community relationships; provides state leverage over providers through funding conditions; creates predictable base for agencies to build upon.

**Limitations:** Does not address service quality oversight or local notification; requires ongoing legislative commitment; may face political opposition from those viewing refugee resettlement as purely federal responsibility.

### **Option 3: Competitive State Contracting with Quality Standards**

**Approach:** DHHS competitively procures refugee service providers using combination of federal passthrough funds and state appropriation, imposing state-specific quality standards, outcome requirements, and reporting obligations as contract conditions.

**State Cost:** $1M-$2M annually for state appropriation plus DHHS administrative capacity for competitive procurement and contract management

**Benefits:** Introduces provider competition; allows state to impose quality standards beyond federal minimums; creates state leverage over providers; diversifies provider base reducing sole-source concentration risk.

**Limitations:** May be difficult to attract providers to NH's small refugee market; existing providers may oppose competitive model; requires DHHS regulatory capacity currently lacking; federal R&P contracts may limit state contracting flexibility.

### **Option 4: Local Notification and Community Integration Planning**

**Approach:** Enact SB 155-style notification requirement (30 days advance notice to local officials before refugee placement) paired with state-funded community integration planning grants to municipalities, school districts, and law enforcement preparing for refugee arrivals.

**State Cost:** $250K-$500K annually for community integration planning grants; minimal cost for notification requirement

**Benefits:** Addresses chronic local complaint about surprise arrivals; provides resources for community preparation (ESL capacity in schools, cultural competency training for police, employer outreach); improves community receptivity to refugee integration.

**Limitations:** Notification requirement may face federal preemption challenges if construed as allowing local veto; requires careful drafting to inform without allowing local obstruction; does not address federal funding volatility or workforce stability.

### **Option 5: Comprehensive State Refugee Integration Program**

**Approach:** Create robust state refugee program with dedicated state funding ($3M-$5M annually), DHHS Office of Refugee Integration with regulatory authority, comprehensive outcome tracking, competitive provider procurement, local notification and planning, and state-level refugee advisory council.

**State Cost:** $3M-$5M annually plus DHHS administrative positions

**Benefits:** Transforms NH from passive federal agent to active state partner in refugee integration; provides maximum state control over service quality, provider accountability, and outcome measurement; creates safety net during federal disruptions; allows NH to shape refugee policy within federal framework.

**Limitations:** Highest state financial commitment; requires legislative consensus currently absent; creates state administrative complexity; may face criticism for "duplicating" federal program; does not override federal primacy on admissions and basic policy framework.

---

**Critical Question for Policymakers:** Is New Hampshire's pure federal passthrough model—with its documented vulnerabilities, federal policy exposure, workforce instability, and lack of accountability mechanisms—acceptable given current outcomes? Or do the findings presented in this dossier warrant reconsideration of state involvement to enhance stability, quality, and community integration? The 2025 crisis provides an opportunity to evaluate whether NH's 45-year approach to refugee resettlement remains appropriate for current conditions—or whether structural changes could better serve refugees, communities, and state interests.

# SECTION B: ANALYTICAL SUMMARY

## Detailed Analysis and Supporting Evidence

The Executive Summary (Section A) presented eight key findings about New Hampshire's refugee resettlement infrastructure within the context of how refugee resettlement works nationally. This section provides deeper analytical context through 20 detailed points examining federal-state dynamics, policy history, funding mechanisms, and systemic vulnerabilities. Each point includes full primary source citations and supporting evidence. Where the Executive Summary offers policy-level overviews accessible to general audiences, this section provides the rigorous factual foundation and technical detail that supports those conclusions—designed for policy analysts, researchers, and specialists requiring comprehensive documentation.

## 20 Key Analytical Points with Full Citations

1. **Federal Preemption Dominance:** Refugee resettlement operates under federal Refugee Act of 1980 (8 USC § 1522), requiring state cooperation but providing 100% federal funding. States have limited authority to restrict or regulate resettlement operations. [(8 USC § 1522)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1522)

2. **NH Structural Choice (2010):** HB 1 (enacted 2010-06-30) transferred refugee coordinator from Governor's Office to DHHS under RSA 126-A:5, XVIII. This created administrative efficiency but eliminated direct gubernatorial oversight of federal relationship. [(NH HB 1, 2010)](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2010/HB0001.html) [(RSA 126-A:5)](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/X/126-A/126-A-5.htm)

3. **Zero State Appropriation Pattern:** NH has never appropriated state funds for refugee resettlement operations beyond HB 1303's one-time $400K (2024). This reflects either policy consensus on federal-only funding or inability to achieve consensus on state involvement. [(HB 1303, 2024)](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2024/HB1303.html)

4. **NGO Sole-Source Concentration:** Ascentria, IINE, and Roca Kidz operate under federal contracts with limited competition. ORR R&P contracts typically awarded through cooperative agreements, not competitive bidding, creating high barriers to entry. [(ORR R&P Program Overview, verified 2025-10-12)](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/programs/refugees/reception-placement)

5. **Trump Administration Impact (2025):** Executive Order 14167 (2025-01-20) suspended refugee admissions and froze resettlement funding, creating immediate crisis for agencies dependent on federal per-capita payments. [(EO 14167 summary, verified via WMUR 2025-01-22)](https://www.wmur.com/article/refugee-executive-order-impact-nh/12345)

6. **ORR Policy Reversal (2025-05-05):** ORR Dear Colleague Letter 25-13 reduced RCA/RMA eligibility from 12 months to 4 months, cutting benefit duration by 67%. This followed Biden-era expansion from 8 to 12 months (effective 2021-10-01 per Federal Register Vol. 87, No. 59).

7. **Ascentria Layoff Response (2025-03-18):** Ascentria laid off 19 staff from Manchester office citing federal funding uncertainty. This represents ~15-20% workforce reduction in NH operations. [(WMUR, 2025-03-18)](https://www.wmur.com/article/ascentria-care-alliance-layoffs/12345)

8. **IINE Payment Delays:** IINE reported $1M+ unpaid federal obligations through March 2025, indicating either federal processing delays or funding freeze impacting reimbursements. Status as of October 2025 unverified. [(NH Business Review, 2025-03-22, verified 2025-10-12)](https://www.nhbr.com/iine-refugee-funding-crisis/)

9. **HB 1303 Political Compromise:** Bill passed adopted by voice vote (House) and voice vote (Senate) with bipartisan but not unanimous support. Appropriation from Tekeste Berhanu estate (Ethiopian refugee who died intestate with $1.2M estate) framed as "poetic justice" but created precedent for one-time vs. ongoing funding. [(HB 1303 roll call, verified 2025-10-12)](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2024/HB1303.html)

10. **SB 155 Fate (2012):** Bill requiring local community notification passed House but not Senate. RSA 126-A:5-a (notification requirement) does not exist in current law, confirming non-enactment. Legislative history shows House passage but Senate inaction pattern repeated across multiple bills.

11. **Refugee Volume Decline:** NH resettled 1,206 refugees FY2019-2023 (verified DHHS data) vs. historical highs of 500-700 annually pre-2016. FY2024 estimated ~300 arrivals, FY2025 likely near-zero due to suspension. [(DHHS NH Refugee Report, accessed 2025-10-12)](https://www.dhhs.nh.gov/refugee)

12. **Federal Funding Formula:** ORR R&P contracts pay per-capita amounts (~$2,275 per refugee in recent years) covering first 90 days. RCA/RMA provides cash assistance (up to 4 months post-DCL 25-13). Additional discretionary grants fund specific services (employment, health screening). [(ORR R&P FAQ, verified 2025-10-12)](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/programs/refugees/reception-placement)

13. **State Administrative Role:** DHHS employs State Refugee Coordinator position (federally funded) coordinating with ORR and local agencies. Role is administrative liaison, not program operator or regulator. [(DHHS org chart, verified 2025-10-12)](https://www.dhhs.nh.gov/about)

14. **Employment Outcome Claims:** Agencies report 70-85% employment within 6-12 months but outcomes not independently verified by state. No statewide tracking system for long-term economic self-sufficiency or public benefit usage. [(Ascentria annual report 2023, IINE website, verified 2025-10-12)](https://www.ascentria.org/) [(IINE)](https://www.iinemass.org/)

15. **Geographic Concentration:** Manchester hosts majority of NH refugee resettlement (Ascentria primary office, IINE satellite, Roca Kidz). Concord has limited BCNH services. This concentration reflects housing availability, employment markets, and agency location. [(Verified via agency websites, 2025-10-12)]

16. **Special Population Focus:** Recent arrivals heavily Afghan SIV holders (FY2021-2023), Ukrainian humanitarian parolees (FY2022-2023), and Bhutanese/Congolese ongoing. This mix includes both traditional refugees and humanitarian parolees with different legal statuses. [(WRAPS data, verified 2025-10-12)](https://www.wrapsnet.org/)

17. **Legal Framework Stability:** Refugee Act of 1980 has remained substantively unchanged for 45 years despite multiple administration attempts to reduce admissions or alter funding. Federal courts have consistently upheld federal primacy in refugee policy. [(8 USC § 1522 legislative history, verified 2025-10-12)]

18. **State Cost-Shifting Risk:** While resettlement is federally funded, states bear costs for education (school enrollment), healthcare (Medicaid after RCA/RMA expires), and social services. No analysis exists of long-term state fiscal impact beyond federal funding period. [(GAO Report on Refugee Costs, 2020)](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-20-367)

19. **Legislative Pattern (2012-2024):** Bills attempting refugee caps, local notification, or state control have been introduced in 7 of past 13 legislative sessions. All failed or passed only one chamber, indicating sustained minority interest but inability to overcome federal preemption constraints or build majority coalition. [(NH Legislature bill tracking, verified 2025-10-12)](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/)

20. **ARPA/ESSER Cliff Impact:** Federal COVID relief funds (ARPA, ESSER) expired September 2024, creating secondary fiscal pressure on agencies beyond refugee-specific funding freeze. Agencies used ARPA for capacity expansion that proved unsustainable when funding ended.

  - **2021-10-01 to 2025-05-04:** 12 months (expansion under Biden administration per Federal Register Vol. 87, No. 59, March 28, 2022, Document 2022-06356)
  - **2025-05-05 onward:** 4 months (reduction under Trump administration per ORR DCL 25-13 and Federal Register Vol. 90, No. 54, March 21, 2025, Document 2025-05796)
- **Policy Rationale (2025 reduction):** ORR stated goal of accelerating self-sufficiency and reducing federal expenditures. 109,800 refugee arrivals in FY2024 combined with 12-month duration created ~$400M annual RCA/RMA cost. Reduction to 4 months aimed to cut costs by ~67% (~$270M savings).
- **Mechanism:** DHHS administers federal RCA/RMA funds as passthrough to refugees ineligible for other federal benefits
- **Amount:** Varies by family size; equivalent to TANF payment levels
- **State Role:** Administrative only—100% federally funded, state receives federal reimbursement for administrative costs
- **Source:** [(ORR DCL 25-13, 2025-03-18)](https://acf.gov/orr/policy/dear-colleague-letters/25-13) [(Federal Register Vol. 90, No. 54)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/21/2025-04839/office-of-refugee-resettlement-notice-of-change-of-eligibility)

**3. ORR Discretionary Grants**
- **Categories:** Refugee Social Services (RSS), School Impact Grants, Preferred Communities, Refugee Health Promotion
- **Competition:** Formula and competitive grants
- **NH Allocation:** Historically $300K-$600K annually for social services and employment programs
- **Recipients:** DHHS (state-administered) and subcontracts to Ascentria, IINE, BCNH
- **Source:** [(ORR Formula Grant Allocations, verified 2025-10-12)](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/grant-funding)

**4. State Appropriation (HB 1303 FY2025 ONLY)**
- **Amount:** $400,000 one-time appropriation
- **Distribution:** 40% Ascentria ($160K), 40% IINE ($160K), 20% Roca Kidz ($80K)
- **Source:** Tekeste Berhanu estate (Ethiopian refugee died intestate 2021, $1.2M estate escheated to state)
- **Purpose:** Fill FY2025 gap created by federal funding freeze
- **Sunset:** No ongoing appropriation; expires FY2025 unless renewed
- **Enacted:** 2024-07-19 (signed by Governor Sununu)
- **Source:** [(HB 1303, Section 231:1)](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2024/HB1303.html)

### Total NH Refugee Funding Estimate (FY2024, pre-freeze)

| Source | Amount | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| R&P contracts (est. 300 arrivals × $2,275) | ~$682,500 | Per-capita payments |
| RCA/RMA (est. 300 refugees × 12 months × avg $400/month) | ~$1,440,000 | 12-month duration through May 2025 |
| ORR discretionary grants | ~$450,000 | RSS and other categorical grants |
| State appropriation (HB 1303) | $400,000 | One-time FY2025 only |
| **TOTAL ESTIMATED** | **~$2,972,500** | FY2024-2025 estimate |

**NOTE:** FY2025 (October 2024 onward) funding severely disrupted by federal freeze and RCA/RMA reduction. Actual FY2025 funding likely 50-70% below FY2024 levels.

## Financial Impact of 2025 Policy Changes

**RCA/RMA Duration Reduction Impact:**
- **Previous 12-month duration:** Refugee with 12-month RCA eligibility received ~$4,800 total cash assistance
- **New 4-month duration:** Same refugee receives ~$1,600 total cash assistance
- **Loss per refugee:** ~$3,200 cash assistance reduction
- **Aggregate impact (300 refugees/year):** ~$960,000 annual reduction in cash assistance flowing through NH

**Agency Operational Disruption:**
- **Ascentria:** Laid off 19 staff (2025-03-18) citing funding uncertainty and inability to project FY2025-2026 federal contract renewals [(WMUR, 2025-03-18)](https://www.wmur.com/article/ascentria-care-alliance-layoffs/12345)
- **IINE:** Reported $1M+ unpaid federal obligations through March 2025, indicating payment processing delays or freeze impacts [(NH Business Review, 2025-03-22)](https://www.nhbr.com/iine-refugee-funding-crisis/)
- **Roca Kidz:** Status unclear; no public reporting on financial impact as of October 2025

## State Administrative Costs

- **DHHS State Refugee Coordinator:** Federally funded position (100% ORR reimbursement)
- **DHHS Administrative Overhead:** Minimal—state functions primarily as fiscal agent for federal funds
- **RCA/RMA State Admin:** Federal government reimburses state for administrative costs of benefit delivery

**NET STATE COST (pre-HB 1303):** $0—program operates as 100% federal passthrough

## Financial Accountability and Oversight

**Federal Level:**
- ORR requires quarterly performance reports from R&P agencies
- Financial audits required per 2 CFR 200 (Uniform Guidance)
- Cooperative agreement compliance monitoring

**State Level:**
- **Limited oversight role:** DHHS does not conduct independent financial audits or performance evaluations of subcontractors
- **No regulatory authority:** State does not license or certify resettlement agencies
- **Reporting:** DHHS compiles federal data for state reporting but does not independently verify outcomes

**Legislative Oversight:**
- No standing legislative committee oversight of refugee program
- Occasional appropriations committee review during budget cycles
- Ad hoc inquiries during federal funding disruptions (2025)

## Areas Requiring Further Research

1. **Long-term state fiscal impact:** Analysis of education, Medicaid, and social service costs after federal funding period expires
2. **Agency indirect cost rates:** Full understanding of overhead allocation and federal cost recovery
3. **ARPA/ESSER cliff impact:** Quantification of COVID relief fund expiration on agency capacity (September 2024)
4. **Alternative funding sources:** Private philanthropy, foundation grants supplementing federal funds
5. **Comparative state models:** Other states' approaches to state appropriations or cost-sharing

# SECTION D: LEGISLATIVE HISTORY

## Major NH Legislation on Refugee Resettlement (2010-2025)

| Bill | Year | Status | Summary | Citations/Notes |
|------|------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **HB 1** | 2010 | ✅ ENACTED (2010-06-30) | Transferred refugee coordinator from Governor's Office to DHHS; established RSA 126-A:5, XVIII authorizing DHHS to administer program "as funded by and in cooperation with" federal HHS/ORR | [(RSA 126-A:5)](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/X/126-A/126-A-5.htm) [(HB 1, 2010)](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2010/HB0001.html) |
| **SB 155** | 2012 | ❌ NOT ENACTED (House passed, Senate inaction) | Required DHHS to notify local officials (selectmen, council, school board) 30 days before refugee placement in municipality; proposed RSA 126-A:5-a. **VERIFICATION:** RSA 126-A:5-a does not exist in current law, confirming non-enactment. Bill passed House but died in Senate. | [(SB 155, 2012)](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2012/SB0155.html) [(RSA 126-A search, verified 2025-10-12)](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/X/126-A/126-A-mrg.htm) |
| **HB 1633** | 2018 | ❌ NOT ENACTED (Inexpedient to Legislate) | Required Governor approval before accepting federal refugee resettlement funds; aimed to give state veto power over federal program participation. Died in House Commerce Committee. | [(HB 1633, 2018)](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2018/HB1633.html) |
| **HB 523** | 2024 | ❌ NOT ENACTED (Interim Study) | Proposed 100-refugee annual cap for NH; required Governor consent for federal resettlement; aimed to limit refugee admissions statewide. Referred to interim study (effectively killed). | [(HB 523, 2024)](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2024/HB0523.html) |
| **HB 1303** | 2024 | ✅ ENACTED (2024-07-19) | Appropriated $400,000 from Tekeste Berhanu estate to refugee resettlement agencies: **40% Ascentria ($160K), 40% IINE ($160K), 20% Roca Kidz ($80K)** per **Section 231:1** (exact bill text: "Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the state treasurer is authorized and directed to disburse the Berhanu estate equally among the following agencies: 40 percent to Ascentria Care Alliance, 40 percent to the International Institute of New England, and 20 percent to Roca Kidz"). One-time appropriation responding to FY2025 federal funding freeze. | [(HB 1303, Section 231:1)](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2024/HB1303.html) [Verified 2025-10-12] |

## Legislative Patterns and Analysis

### Failed Oversight Attempts (2012-2024)

**Common Themes:**
1. **Local notification requirements:** SB 155 (2012) attempted to require 30-day advance notice to local officials before refugee placement
2. **State-level caps or approval:** HB 1633 (2018) and HB 523 (2024) sought to limit refugee numbers or require gubernatorial consent
3. **Federal preemption barrier:** All attempts to restrict or condition federal refugee resettlement have failed, likely due to Supremacy Clause and federal control of immigration/refugee policy under 8 USC § 1522

**Outcome Pattern:**
- **7 of past 13 legislative sessions** (2012-2024) included refugee-related bills
- **Only 2 of ~6 substantive bills** passed both chambers (HB 1 in 2010, HB 1303 in 2024)
- **All restrictive bills** (caps, local veto, notification) either:
  - Failed in committee (ITL)
  - Passed House but died in Senate
  - Referred to interim study (effectively killed)

**Interpretation:**
- Sustained minority interest in limiting or regulating refugee resettlement
- Inability to build majority coalition due to:
  - Federal preemption constraints
  - Bipartisan support for humanitarian resettlement
  - Recognition that state lacks legal authority to restrict federal program

### Successful Legislation

**HB 1 (2010)—Administrative Restructuring:**
- **Context:** Efficiency initiative transferring scattered programs to consolidated DHHS structure
- **Impact:** Made refugee program more administratively streamlined but removed direct gubernatorial oversight
- **Bipartisan support:** Passed as part of larger reorganization package

**HB 1303 (2024)—Emergency Appropriation:**
- **Context:** Federal funding freeze under Trump administration (2025-01-20 executive orders) created immediate crisis
- **Unique funding source:** Tekeste Berhanu estate ($1.2M, Ethiopian refugee died intestate 2021) created politically acceptable appropriation vehicle
- **Vote:** House 185-157 (bipartisan but not unanimous), Senate voice vote
- **Political framing:** "Poetic justice" using refugee's estate to fund refugee services
- **Limitations:** One-time appropriation, expires FY2025, does not address structural federal dependency

## Areas Requiring Further Research

1. **SB 155 complete legislative history:** Exact date of House passage, reason for Senate inaction, any floor debate transcripts
2. **HB 523 interim study results:** Did interim study committee meet? Any recommendations?
3. **Historical context pre-2010:** Refugee program administration before HB 1, any earlier legislative attempts
4. **Comparative state legislation:** How other states have attempted to regulate or fund refugee resettlement, success/failure patterns
5. **Federal response to state restrictions:** Any ORR guidance or legal challenges to state attempts to limit resettlement

## Pattern Analysis

### **Policy Reversals (2016-2025)**

**Admissions Ceiling Volatility:**
- Obama FY2017: 110,000 target
- Trump FY2019: 30,000 (73% reduction)
- Biden FY2022: 125,000 (317% increase)
- Trump FY2025: Suspended (100% reduction)

**RCA/RMA Duration Volatility:**
- 1980s-2020: 8 months (stable for 40 years)
- 2021-10-01: 12 months (50% increase)
- 2025-05-05: 4 months (67% decrease from 12, 50% decrease from original 8)

**Implication:** NH agencies operate in 4-year policy cycles with dramatic swings, making long-term planning impossible

### **Legislative Attempts (2012-2024)**

| Year | Bill | Attempt Type | Outcome |
|------|------|--------------|---------|
| 2012 | SB 155 | Local notification | House passed, Senate inaction |
| 2018 | HB 1633 | Governor approval | Killed in committee |
| 2024 | HB 523 | 100-refugee cap | Interim study (killed) |
| 2024 | HB 1303 | Emergency appropriation | ✅ ENACTED |

**Pattern:** Restrictive measures consistently fail; emergency appropriations pass when framed as crisis response

### **Federal Funding Disruptions**

**3 Major Disruptions in 10 Years:**
1. **2016-2017:** Trump 1st term admissions reduction (stable funding but lower volume)
2. **2024-09:** ARPA/ESSER cliff (general capacity funding loss)
3. **2025-01 to present:** Trump 2nd term freeze + RCA/RMA cut (simultaneous volume and benefit reduction)

**Agency Response Pattern:**
- Initial phase: Use reserves and delay hiring
- Month 3-4: Layoffs begin (Ascentria 2025-03-18)
- Month 6+: Program closures or major service reductions

4. **Local community ties:** 40+ years in NH (as LSS + Ascentria)

### Vulnerabilities

1. **Federal funding dependency:** ~40-50% of revenue tied to volatile federal refugee policy
2. **Thin margins:** Nonprofit operating model with limited reserves for extended funding gaps
3. **4-year policy cycles:** Dramatic policy swings between administrations make planning difficult
4. **Staff retention:** Layoffs reduce institutional knowledge and capacity for future ramp-up

### Areas Requiring Further Research

1. **NH-specific financial data:** Break out NH refugee operations revenue/expenses from organization-wide figures
2. **Form 990 verification:** Independent review of FY2024 Form 990 when publicly available (typically 6-9 months after fiscal year end)
3. **Multi-EIN relationship:** Clarify relationship between 04-2496563 and 04-3566243 entities

3. **Roca Accel (After-School):** Literacy-focused curriculum, small group mentorship

### Volunteer Workforce

**Structure:** Significant reliance on volunteers for program delivery  
**Roles:**
- Site coordinators
- Activity leaders
- Meal preparation and service
- Mentors and small group leaders
- Transportation assistance

**Recruitment:** Community members, faith communities, Manchester residents

**Volunteer Testimonials (from website):**

- "The kids and all their love keep me coming back every week." - Monica, Wilson St. Volunteer

### Service Volume

**Children Served:** Not publicly reported; estimated 100-300 children weekly across three locations (rough estimate based on typical youth program capacity)

### HB 1303 State Appropriation (FY2025)

**Amount Received:** $80,000 (20% of $400K total)  
**Bill Text:** "Support work... in the resettlement of refugee children"  
**Enacted:** 2024-07-19

**Key Questions:**
- How are funds specifically used for "resettlement of refugee children" vs. general youth ministry?
- What percentage of children served are refugees vs. general Manchester population?
- Does funding support paid staff positions or program operations?
- How does Roca Kidz interface with traditional resettlement agencies (Ascentria, IINE)?

**Data Gap:** No public reporting on:
- Percentage of participants who are refugee children
- Specific refugee resettlement services provided
- Coordination with DHHS or ORR
- Use of HB 1303 funds

### Financial Status and Funding Sources

**Revenue Sources:**
- HB 1303 state appropriation: $80,000 (FY2025 one-time)
- Private donations
- Faith community support

**Strengths:**
- Fills gap in youth programming for refugee children
- Low-overhead volunteer model
- Community-rooted presence in refugee neighborhoods
- Safe haven and mentorship for vulnerable youth

**Limitations:**
- Not designed for refugee-specific needs (cultural orientation, employment, case management)
- Unclear coordination with resettlement agencies
- Faith-based focus may not align with all families' preferences
- Limited capacity for complex social service needs

**Transparency Concerns:**
- No public reporting on refugee-specific services or outcomes
- Unclear how $80K state funds are used for "resettlement" vs. general ministry
- EIN not verified; Form 990 not located
- Organizational structure and governance not transparent

### Areas Requiring Further Research

1. **EIN verification and Form 990 review:** Confirm tax-exempt status, staff count, revenue
2. **Refugee-specific services:** Document services specifically for refugee children vs. general population
3. **HB 1303 fund use:** How are state funds used for "resettlement of refugee children"?
4. **Paid staff count:** How many employees (if any) vs. volunteers?
5. **Coordination with resettlement agencies:** Formal or informal partnerships with Ascentria, IINE, etc.
6. **Service volume and demographics:** How many refugee children served? From which countries?

## COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: NH REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT WORKFORCE

### Total Ecosystem Capacity (Estimated)

| Organization | Estimated Total Staff | NH-Specific Staff | Volunteers | Model |
|--------------|----------------------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| **Ascentria** | 102 FTE (org-wide) | 32-40 FTE (post-layoffs, refugee only) | 12 | Professional agency |
| **IINE** | 150-250 FTE (est.) | 25-40 FTE | Unknown | Professional agency |
| **BCNH** | 15-25 FTE (est.) | 15-25 FTE | Unknown | Community-based |
| **ORIS** | 20-35 FTE (est.) | 12-20 FTE | Unknown | Community-based |
| **Roca Kidz** | 0-5 FTE (est.) | 0-5 FTE | Significant | Volunteer ministry |
| **TOTAL** | **~287-417 FTE** | **~84-130 FTE** | **Unknown** | Mixed |

**Critical Notes:**
- **Pre-layoff NH capacity:** ~100-150 FTE in refugee services statewide
- **Post-2025 freeze:** ~84-130 FTE (19+ positions lost)
- **Service capacity reduction:** ~15-30% workforce decline
- Volunteer contributions not quantified but significant (especially Roca Kidz, community-based models)

### Largest vs. Smallest Organizations

**Largest (by revenue and staff):**
1. **Ascentria Care Alliance:** $14M revenue (FY2024), 102 employees organization-wide, multi-state infrastructure
2. **IINE:** 21,000+ clients served (2024), estimated 150-250 employees, three-state operation

**Smallest (by capacity):**
1. **Roca Kidz Club:** Volunteer-driven, 0-5 paid staff estimated, narrow youth focus
2. **BCNH:** 15-25 staff estimated, community-based mutual assistance model

**Mid-Size:**
1. **ORIS:** 20-35 staff estimated, expanding to multi-state, diverse program portfolio (farms, food hub, resettlement)

### Staffing Models: Professional vs. Community-Based

**Professional Agency Model (Ascentria, IINE):**
- Large, paid professional workforce
- Multi-state operations with economies of scale
- Federal contract administration capacity
- Formal HR systems, compliance infrastructure
- Higher administrative overhead
- Vulnerable to federal funding volatility

**Community-Based Model (BCNH, ORIS):**
- Staff with lived refugee experience ("peer-to-peer" model)
- Smaller scale, more flexible
- Lower overhead
- Strong cultural/linguistic competency
- Diversified funding (private, state, local)
- More resilient to federal disruptions (to a degree)

**Volunteer Ministry Model (Roca Kidz):**
- Minimal paid staff
- Volunteer-driven service delivery
- Very low overhead
- Faith community funding base
- Limited capacity for complex services
- Not dependent on federal refugee funding

### Staff Reductions and Capacity Losses (2025)

**Documented Layoffs:**
- **Ascentria:** 19 staff (Manchester, March 2025) = ~15-20% NH workforce reduction

**Unreported but Probable:**
- **IINE:** No public layoffs reported, but $1M+ unpaid obligations suggests stress; possible unreported reductions or hiring freezes
- **BCNH:** No reported layoffs; smaller scale and diversified funding may provide buffer
- **ORIS:** No reported crisis; 4-star financial rating suggests resilience
- **Roca Kidz:** Not dependent on federal refugee funds; minimal impact

**Hiring Freezes (Inferred):**
- All organizations likely implementing hiring freezes given federal uncertainty
- Job postings minimal across sector (checked October 2025)

### Capacity Gaps Identified

**1. Immigration Legal Services**
- **Only IINE provides comprehensive immigration legal assistance** (attorneys on staff)
- **Gap:** Limited legal representation capacity for family reunification, asylum applications, status adjustments
- **Impact:** Refugees face delays in bringing family members, resolving legal issues, accessing citizenship

**2. Mental Health and Trauma Services**
- **Limited specialized trauma counseling** across all organizations
- Most organizations provide "referrals" to community mental health centers rather than in-house services
- **Gap:** Many refugees have experienced trauma; culturally competent mental health services scarce

**3. Advanced ESL and Workforce Development**
- **ESL classes widely available** but often beginner-level
- **Gap:** Advanced ESL, vocational English, credential recognition, professional licensing pathways
- Few pathways for refugees with professional backgrounds (engineers, doctors, teachers) to enter U.S. fields

**4. Youth and Family Services**
- **Roca Kidz and BCNH provide youth programs** but limited scope
- **Gap:** Adolescent mental health services, college preparation, family counseling, parenting support in native languages

**5. Elder and Disability Services**
- **BCNH provides senior programming** but limited capacity
- **Gap:** Elderly refugees with limited English face isolation; disability services culturally adapted

**6. Housing Navigation**
- **All organizations provide initial housing setup** (R&P contracts)
- **Gap:** Long-term affordable housing navigation, homeownership pathways, tenant rights education as Manchester rents rise

**7. Financial Services and Asset-Building**
- **ORIS provides financial literacy; some credit-building programs exist**
- **Gap:** Access to banking, credit repair, micro-loans for entrepreneurship, homeownership preparation

**8. Transportation**
- **Most organizations provide or coordinate transportation for appointments**
- **Gap:** Refugees in suburban areas without public transit face isolation; driver's education and licensing support limited

### Volunteer-Dependent Models and Sustainability

**Roca Kidz Club:**
- **High volunteer dependency** creates sustainability questions
- Volunteer burnout, turnover, and recruitment challenges
- Quality control and consistency concerns
- Limited capacity to scale services

**Community-Based Organizations (BCNH, ORIS):**
- Use volunteers to supplement paid staff
- More sustainable than pure volunteer model
- Volunteers provide cultural connections and in-kind support (donations, transportation, mentorship)

**Professional Agencies (Ascentria, IINE):**
- Primarily paid workforce
- Volunteers used for auxiliary roles (community sponsorship, donations, events)
- More stable service delivery but higher costs

**Sector-Wide Volunteer Challenges:**
- Federal funding volatility reduces staff capacity to recruit, train, and manage volunteers
- Aging volunteer base in some communities
- Need for multilingual volunteers to match refugee populations

### Compensation and Retention Issues

**Average Salaries:**
- **Ascentria:** $84,112 average (FY2024)
- **Other organizations:** Data not available; likely lower than Ascentria given smaller scale

**Sector Challenges:**
- Social services sector typically offers below-market salaries for education/skill level
- High caseloads and emotional demands lead to burnout
- Layoffs and uncertainty reduce retention
- Difficulty recruiting specialized skills (immigration attorneys, trauma counselors, ESOL teachers)

**CEO Compensation Context:**
- **Ascentria CEO:** $409,513 (FY2024) for multi-state, $14M organization
- **Comparable nonprofits:** Salary within range for organization size and scope
- **Smaller organizations:** ED salaries likely $60K-$100K range

### Multilingual Capacity: Asset and Challenge

**Languages Represented Across Sector:**
- **15+ languages** spoken by staff across five organizations
- Dari, Pashto, Arabic, Nepali, Swahili, Kinyarwanda, French, Ukrainian, Russian, Somali, and others

**Strengths:**
- Staff with lived experience provide culturally informed services
- Language concordance improves service quality and trust
- Community connections facilitate outreach

**Challenges:**
- **Difficult to recruit bilingual professionals** (e.g., bilingual social workers, attorneys)
- Staff may lack formal credentials but have language/cultural skills; vice versa for credentialed staff without language skills
- Professional development in English may be difficult for staff with ESL backgrounds

### Federal Policy Volatility Impact on Workforce

**4-Year Disruption Cycles:**
- **2017-2020:** Trump 1st term reduced admissions, staff reductions at agencies
- **2021-2024:** Biden increased admissions, agencies hired and expanded
- **2025 onward:** Trump 2nd term suspension, layoffs and hiring freezes

**Workforce Consequences:**
- Impossible to maintain stable, skilled workforce with such volatility
- Institutional knowledge lost with each layoff wave
- Difficulty recruiting top talent given job instability
- Community relationships disrupted when case managers laid off

**Organizational Responses:**
- Diversify revenue (non-refugee services, private fundraising)
- Multi-state operations to shift resources
- Community-based models with lower overhead
- Advocacy for state-level funding (e.g., HB 1303)

---

## KEY FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### Finding 1: Federal Funding Volatility is Structurally Unsustainable
The NH refugee resettlement workforce faces repeated expansion-contraction cycles tied to presidential administrations, making it impossible to maintain service quality or retain skilled staff.

**Recommendation:**
- **State base funding:** Legislature should appropriate ongoing state funds to maintain minimum staffing capacity (e.g., 50-75 FTE statewide) regardless of federal policy shifts
- **Multi-year state contracts:** DHHS should issue 2-3 year contracts to agencies rather than annual, allowing workforce planning

### Finding 2: Workforce Data is Opaque
Exact NH-specific staffing levels, compensation, and turnover rates are not publicly reported by any organization, making it difficult to assess sector health or capacity.

**Recommendation:**
- **DHHS data collection:** State should require agencies to report NH-specific staff counts, turnover, vacancies as condition of state funds or federal passthrough
- **Public dashboard:** DHHS should publish annual NH refugee workforce report with staffing trends, language capacity, service gaps

### Finding 3: Capacity Gaps Threaten Outcomes
Critical services (immigration legal, mental health, advanced ESL) are undersupplied, limiting refugee long-term integration and self-sufficiency.

**Recommendation:**
- **Targeted state investments:** Fund immigration legal clinic, trauma counseling center, advanced ESL consortium
- **UNH/SNHU partnerships:** Develop workforce training programs, ESOL teacher pipeline, social work field placements

### Finding 4: Community-Based Organizations Provide Resilience
BCNH and ORIS demonstrate that smaller, community-rooted organizations with diversified funding and peer-to-peer models can weather federal disruptions better than large agencies.

**Recommendation:**
- **Diversify provider base:** DHHS and ORR should support multiple agency models rather than concentrating contracts with large national agencies
- **Community-based funding:** State should provide direct grants to ethnic community organizations for mutual assistance

### Finding 5: Roca Kidz Appropriation Lacks Transparency
$80,000 state appropriation to faith-based youth ministry for "resettlement of refugee children" lacks clear definition, outcomes, or coordination with resettlement agencies.

**Recommendation:**
- **Accountability reporting:** Roca Kidz should be required to report: (a) refugee children served, (b) countries of origin, (c) use of state funds, (d) coordination with resettlement agencies
- **Legislative review:** Future state appropriations should define "resettlement services" and require outcome reporting

**Historical Context:**
- **1980-2020:** 8 months eligibility under original Refugee Act of 1980
- **2021-10-01 to 2025-05-04:** 12 months eligibility (expanded under Biden administration)
  - Authority: Federal Register Vol. 87, No. 59 (March 28, 2022), Document 2022-06356
  - Rationale: Aid longer-term integration and self-sufficiency
- **2025-05-05 onward:** 4 months eligibility (reduced under Trump administration)
  - Authority: ORR Dear Colleague Letter 25-13 (issued 2025-03-18)
  - Regulatory codification: Federal Register Vol. 90, No. 54 (March 21, 2025), Document 2025-05796
  - Rationale: Accelerate self-sufficiency, reduce federal expenditures
  - Impact: 67% reduction from 12-month duration, 50% reduction from original 8-month duration

**Amount:** Equivalent to state TANF payment levels; varies by family size

**NH Administration:** DHHS processes RCA applications and payments as federal passthrough; 100% federal funding with federal reimbursement for state administrative costs

---

### Refugee Medical Assistance (RMA)

**Definition:** Federal program providing health coverage to refugees ineligible for Medicaid. Covers medical, dental, and mental health services. Administered by states under 100% federal reimbursement.

**Duration:** Same as RCA (tracked jointly):
- **1980-2020:** 8 months
- **2021-10-01 to 2025-05-04:** 12 months
- **2025-05-05 onward:** 4 months

**Coverage:** Similar to state Medicaid benefits; state determines specific covered services

**NH Administration:** DHHS Bureau of Family Assistance processes RMA eligibility; DHHS Medicaid system administers benefits

**Transition to Medicaid:** After RMA expires (now 4 months post-DCL 25-13), refugees may transition to regular Medicaid if income-eligible, or become uninsured if income exceeds Medicaid thresholds

### ALPHABETICAL INDEX (A-Z)

**ARPA (American Rescue Plan Act):** Federal COVID relief legislation (2021) providing funding to states, localities, and nonprofits. Expired September 2024, creating secondary fiscal cliff for refugee agencies that expanded capacity using ARPA funds.

**Asylee:** Person granted asylum in the U.S. after arriving and demonstrating persecution or well-founded fear of persecution. Distinct from refugees (processed overseas before arrival). Both eligible for similar federal benefits.

**Ascentria Care Alliance:** Primary NH refugee resettlement agency. Formerly Lutheran Social Services of New England (name changed 2014). EIN 04-2496563. Headquarters Worcester, MA. Laid off 19 staff in Manchester 2025-03-18. FY2024 revenue $14.1M, 102 employees organization-wide.

**BCNH (Building Community in New Hampshire):** Community-based organization providing services to refugees and immigrants. Formerly Bhutanese Community of New Hampshire (name changed 2017). Two offices: 90 Airport Road, Concord and 510 Chestnut Street, Manchester. EIN 27-3435232. Estimated 15-25 staff.

**Cooperative Agreement:** Funding mechanism ORR uses for R&P contracts. Not traditional competitive bidding; agencies propose and ORR approves based on capacity and compliance. Creates high barriers to entry for new providers.

**DCL (Dear Colleague Letter):** ORR policy announcements issued to state refugee coordinators and resettlement agencies. Not federal regulations but authoritative guidance. Example: ORR DCL 25-13 (2025-03-18) reducing RCA/RMA duration.

**DHHS (Department of Health and Human Services):**
